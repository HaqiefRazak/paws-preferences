## Paws & Preferences: Find Your Favourite Kitty

## Objectives
- We'd like you to build a small web application that helps discover what kind of cats or kittens a user prefers.
- The core idea is to present a series of cat pictures and allow the user to express whether they like each one or not, using swipe gestures similar to popular dating apps.

## Requirements
1. A single-page web application where users can view a stack of cat images.
2. Users should be able to swipe right to indicate "like" and swipe left to indicate "dislike".
3. Once the user has gone through all the cats, show a summary of how many cats they liked and display the ones they liked.
4. The cat pictures should be sourced from Cataas (https://cataas.com/).
5. The interface should work smoothly on mobile devices, especially focusing on an intuitive and pleasant mobile viewing experience.
6. Beyond this, how you implement the app- including tech choice, UI/UX design, animations, and any added functionality is completely up to you.

## Deliverables
1. A link to the hosted website on GitHub Pages.
2. A link to the public GitHub repository containing the source code.

## Notes
You can assume a fixed number of cat pictures (e.g. 10-20) for the exercise.
